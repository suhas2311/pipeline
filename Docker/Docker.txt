Docker 
	Docker is one of the tools that used the idea of the isolated resources to 
	create a container that allows applications to be packaged with all the 
	dependencies installed and ran wherever we wanted.
	
	Docker can only run on Linux machines this means I cant install Dokcer directly on Windows or any other OS.
	If I want install Docker on windows then I need to run a Linux VM in windows on top that I need to run Docker.

Virtualization (VM)
	- VM is way of running virtual OS on top a host OS using a special software called Hyperviser.
	- VM directly shares the harware of the host OS. 

					VM 					vs 			Containerisation 
	1. Virtualization at hardware level  		1. Virtualization at OS level 
	2. Heavyweight - consume more host 			2. Lightweight
	   resources 	
	3. VM useses hypervisor 					3. containerisation tool is used 
	4. limited performace - Boot up time        4. Native performace - usualy boot 
		is more which is in minutes 			   fast in seconds.
	5. Cosumes more storage 					5. Shres OS storage means only uses 
												   required storage.
	6. Supports all OS 							6. Supports on Linux

host machine 
	This is the machine in which docker is running 

Docker installation

1. Update ubuntu 
	sudo apt update 

2. Install support packages for Docker
	sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lab-release

3. Need add key to download Docker 
	sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
	
	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg	

4. Add docker packages to apt repository 
	echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

5. Install Docker 
	sudo apt-get update
 	sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin


Assignment: 1. Create docker hub account 

Login to your hub account 
	docker login 

Just try 
	STEP 1: create directory in /home/ubuntu/jenkins_home 
	STEP 2: docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /home/ubuntu/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts


Docker images 
	
To Download a images from docker hub / any registry 
	docker pull <image_name>:<tag>
	note: 1. The default tag will be always latest.
	      2. if we wont specify any tag latest will be considered 
To Delete docker image/images
	docker rmi <image1> <image2> .....

To Delete all the local images 
	docker images -q | xargs -I{} docker rmi "{}"
	docker rmi $(docker images -q)

To push a image to your repo 

		1. Create a tag which matches your repo syntax 
			docker tag <old_name> <new_name>
			
			ex: docker tag ubuntu:22.10 harshajain/test:1.0
		
		2. Push the image 	
			docoker push <username>/<image_name>:<tag>	
		
			ex: docker push harshajain/test:1.0


Docker container 
	A container is a set of isolated processes and resources. Linux achieves 
	this by using namespaces, which allows processes to access only resources 
	in that particular namespace, which allows having a process tree means set 
	of processes that is completely independent of the rest of the systems processes.
	
	Docker definition: A container is a standard unit of software that packages 
	up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably 
	from one computing environment to another.

To list all running containers 
	docker ps
	docker container ls 

To list all the containers (running, paused, stopped)
	docker ps 
	docker container ls -a

To delete a container 
	docker rm <conatiner_id>
	docker container rm <container_id>

To stop all running containers 
	docker stop $(docker ps -q)

To delete all stopped containers 
	docker rm $(docker ps --filter "status=exited" -q)
				(or)
	docker container prune
To delete one or more container 	
		docker rm <conainter_id1> <conainter_id2> .... 
		
		To delete a running container 
			1. Forcefully - docker rm -f <conainter_id>
			2. Grace fully - docker rm $(docker stop <conainter_id>) 
						          (or)
					 docker stop <conainter_id> | xargs -I{} docker rm "{}"	

To create a container from a image 
	docker run -it -d --name <container_name> <image_repo>:<tag>

	Note:	-i: Interactive mode
		-t: tty terminal 
		-d: detached mode (creates container in background)
		--name: The name for the container to be created
		1. Always provide image name at the end of the command 
		
To login / get inside a container 
	docker attach <container_ID>  
		(safe exit <ctrl>+qp)
			(OR)
	docker exec -it <container_ID> <shell_to_run>

	ex: docker exec -it my_ubuntu /bin/bash 
	    docker exec -it my_alpine /bin/sh	


How to customise Docker image / How to write a Dockerfile
		
	Dockerfile
		Dockerfile is used to create custom images by using any stock image or other image as base image.
		In Dockerfile we can write some set of instructions to update any image.
	
		To create image from Dockerfile
			docker build -t my_ubuntu .
	
	FROM ubuntu
		FROM is the first instruction in the every Dockerfile
		FROM is used to specify the base image on top which all the other 
			instruction will run in the same Dockerfile.
			
		FROM <image_name>:<tag>
		
	RUN 
		Normal shell command or the commands supported by the base image are executed using this instruction.
		we can have n number of RUN in a single Dockerfile.
		
		Normal command format 
			RUN <command>
			
		exec format 
			RUN ['<command>','<param1>','<param2>']	
			RUN ['apt','update']	
			RUN ['apt','install','-y','git']	
			RUN ['ls','-lrt']	 
			
	ENV 
		- This instruction is used to set the environment variable inside the container.
		
		ENV <variable_name> <value>
		ENV <variable_name>=<value>
		
		multiple variables
			ENV <variable_name>=<value> <variable_name>=<value> <variable_name>=<value> ....
		
		To create environment variables at run time 
			- using -e or --env option at the runtime we can create env variables 
			- For multiple variables use multiple -e 

		ex:	docker run .... -e <variable_name>=<value> -e <variable_name>=<value> ....	
		
		The best way to load multiple env variable is using env file 
			using --env-file <file_path> at the runtime (with docker run command) we can 
			load the env file containing n number variables. 
	
	ARG
		Using ARG we can pass parameters to Dockerfile as user inputs 
			
		ARG <var_name>=<default_value>

		To pass the value at build time 
			docker build --build-arg <var_name>=<value> ....

COPY and ADD 
	Both copy and add instruction is used to copy files and directories from 
	host machine build location to the image and the container created from it.
	
	ADD supports extra source formats 
	  - If the source is a compressed file then ADD will automatically uncompress it 
	    in the destination.
	  - If the source is a downloadable link then ADD will automatically download the 
	    file in the destination.

	COPY <source_path_from_build_context> <destination_inside_image>	  
	ADD <source_path_from_build_context> <destination_inside_image>	  


CMD and ENTRYPOINT
		shell format 
			CMD "ls -lrt"
			ENTRYPOINT "ls -lrt"
			
		EXEC Format
			CMD ["ls","-l","-rt"]
			ENTRYPOINT ["ls","-lrt"]
			
		- Both CMD and ENTRYPOINT are used to define the execution command of the container which will be created 
		  from this image.
		- If we use multiple CMD or ENTRYPOINT in the same Dockerfile only the latest one will be considered 
		  and all the other CMD or ENTRYPOINT will be ignored.	
		- If we use both CMD and ENTRYPOINT in the same Dockerfile, ENTRYPOINT will get the 
		  higest priority and the command of CMD will become as argumetns to ENTRYPOINT	
		  
		 Difference  
		  -	CMD command can be overridden at the runtime.	
		  - ENTRYPOINT can't be overridden at the runtime but the runtime command
		    will become parameters to ENTRYPOINT command.
		  
		Note: Q. Can we override ENTRYPOINT 
				 Yes, after docker 1.6 version docker has given option to over
					  Entrypoint command at the runtime using --entrypoint 
	
	EXPOSE 
		EXPOSE <port_number>
		- Used to expose a port to the docker network 
		- This is make the  port accessible by all the other containers in the 
		  same docker network.	

	WORKDIR
		This is used to set the working directory for all the instructions that follows it
		such as RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, ADD
		
		WORKDIR <path>
	

IQ: What is the difference b/w CMD and ENTRYPOINT
    What is the difference b/w COPY and ADD 	
    What is the difference b/w ENV and ARG

Dangling Images 
	Dangling images are created while executing layers in image build process that have no relationship 
	to any tagged images. They no longer serve a purpose and it consume disk space.
	
	To list dangling images 
	    docker images -f dangling=true
	
	To remove only dangling images 
	    docker rmi $(docker images -f dangling=true -q)

   	To delete all unused images including dangling image
	    docker image prune

	    docker system prune 
		Remove all unused containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced),
		and optionally, volumes. 
		This will remove:
  		  - all stopped containers
  		  - all networks not used by at least one container
  		  - all dangling images
  		  - all dangling build cache

Docker Volumes
 	- As the layers inside the image are readonly which means once the image is created 
	  we cannot change/edit so we cannot put the conatainer data in image.
	- Container create a top most RW layer and all the runtime data is saved here. 
	- Container layer is temparary layer, If we loose the container we loose data. so
	  to retain/persist the container runtime data we need docker volumes.

	Bind Mounts 
		- we can mount host machine filesystem (files and directories) to the container
		
			docker run -v <host_path>:<container_path>
	
	Docker Volumes		
		- These are docker managed filesystem and we use docker commands to manage these
		  volumes 
		- Volumes are easier to manage, backup or migrate than bind mounts.
		- Volumes supports many drivers which means we can maunt many types of filesystem.
		- Default location of docker volume is /var/lib/docker/volumes  	
		
		docker run -v <volume_name>:<container_path>
		
		To create volume 
			docker volume create <volume_name>
			
		To list volume 
			docker volume ls	
			
		To Delete volume 
			docker volume rm <volume_name>




Multistage build 
	How to optimize docker build process ?
	How to reduce the size of the docker image or cotainer ? 

	After docker 1.6 version docker released this option.
	1. There are 2 problems with the normal build process 
			1. Size: challenge is to keep the image and its containers size as minimal as  		
			   possible.
			2. larger the surface area more the application is vurnalable to attacks. 
	
		- Multistage build allows us to define multiple FROM in same Dockerfile.
		- Dependency between multile FROM is maintained by naming FROM using 
		  AS keyword and we can refer this name in another FROM.

				FROM <base_image> AS <STAGE_NAME>
				
		- Only the final FROM image is created leaving back all the other FROM.
		- Copy only the required files from the named FROM stage like below.
				FROM final_build
				COPY --from <STAGE_NAME> <src_named_stage> <dest>
	
	2. Always try to use the slim / alpine / stretch version of base image instead 
	   of using the fully loaded base image.
	   

Build and deploy maven application using docker.
	docker build -t maven-app .
	docker stop calc
	docker cp calc:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/calculator.war /home/ubuntu/
	docker run -it --rm -d -p 8095:8080 --name calc maven-app 
		
Docker maven direct run example 

	To build the war file
		docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/libraries:/root/.m2 -w /app -v "$(pwd)":/app maven mvn clean package
	
	To build the war file with test phase skipped
		docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/libraries:/root/.m2 -w /app -v "$(pwd)":/app maven mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
	
	To run a test sever for Integration test 
		docker run -it -d --rm -v maven_repo:/root/.m2 \
    			-v "$(pwd)":/app -w /app \
   		 	-p 9999:9999 \
    			--network maven \
    			--name jetty_container maven:3.8.6-openjdk-18-slim mvn jetty:run

	To run Junit test 
		docker run -it --rm -v maven_repo:/root/.m2 \
   			-v "$(pwd)":/app -w /app \
    			--network maven maven:3.8.6-openjdk-18-slim mvn clean test		

	To run Integration test 
		docker run -it --rm -v maven_repo:/root/.m2 \
    			-v "$(pwd)":/app -w /app \
    			--network maven maven:3.8.6-openjdk-18-slim mvn clean integration-test 

Docker networking 
	Publish 
		PUBLISH = Expose + outside world port mapping 
			
	- publics will bind the container port to the host port which we can access from 
	  outside world using <host_ip>:<port_mapped>
	
	- To publish a port 
		docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> .....
		
	-P publish_all
		It binds all the exposed ports of the container to host machine port
		
	To map direct IP address to the host 
		port to port 
			ip:<host_port>:<container_port>
			ip::<container_port>
			
	Range of ports 
		many to one 
			-p 8080-8090:8080
		many to many 
			-p 8080-8085:8086-8091
			 - The total number of host ports in range should be same as the 
			   total number of container ports range.
